# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this project is to show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.
To do this, we used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website to retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. 

We use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data, and the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and make the earthquake data interactive.
